Next Steps: 

~ Add style to the res.send pages when no user is found and when login information is incorrect.

~ Create an option for each logged in user to "like" or save a restaurant and have that restaurant saved to their account.

~ Adjust CSS for phone view.

~ A larger vision - have each user account linked to their own 'my restaurant story'. Account users can comment on another user's 'my restaurant story' but cannot make changes.
